in 87 huey released this "fore" their most accomplished album. i think their undisputed masterpiece is "hip to be square" a song so catchy most people don't listen to the lyrics but they should because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends it's also a personal statement about the band itself. hey paul
